## Project Title
**Flutter Riverpod Task Management App**

## Project Description
The Flutter Riverpod Task Management App is a modern task management solution designed to demonstrate the application of clean architecture principles, efficient state management, and database integration using Flutter and Riverpod. This project showcases the following key features and technologies:

- **Technologies Used:**
  - **Flutter**: For crafting the UI and ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
  - **Riverpod**: Chosen as the state management solution for its declarative and efficient approach to managing application state.
  - **SQLite**: Provides local data persistence to enable offline access to tasks.
  - **Google Crashlytics**: Integrated for monitoring app performance and identifying potential issues in production.
  - **Hugging Face AI Models**: Adds advanced capabilities like natural language processing and smart task suggestions.

- **Key Functionalities:**
  - Task creation, deletion, and updating (CRUD operations).
  - Persistent local storage with SQLite for offline data management.
  - Error handling and state updates to ensure seamless user experience.
  - Scalability and modularity through the repository and datasource layers.

### Challenges and Future Improvements
- **Challenges:**
  - Debugging Riverpod state updates to ensure the UI reflects the most current data.

- **Future Improvements:**
  - Enhance UI/UX with animations and advanced interactions.
  - Add notification support to remind users of pending tasks.
  - Implement cloud-based synchronization for cross-device task management.

## Credits
This project was inspired by the original [Flutter Riverpod To-Do App](https://github.com/IsaiasCuvula/flutter_riverpod_todo_app) by [Isaias](https://youtu.be/vfhbCSTxi74?si=dYzpKnOqXrOnq3-X), check out his cool youtube channel. While the base structure served as a starting point, new features and enhancements were added, including:
- Refined state management logic using Riverpod.
- Enhanced error handling for smoother user experience.
- Integration of Hugging Face AI models for intelligent task suggestions.
